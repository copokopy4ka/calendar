> When the work on the project was almost finished, I turned to
> the best Quality Assurance for UI/UX testing - my Mom!
> I asked to look at the app in the browser
> (with which she is very careful not to delete anything on the Internet..),
> to understand what it is in front of her and what it can do, and gave no hints!
> The application passed the quality check with almost no comments,
> so our Calendar is recommended by my Mom.

_✨ I wish you all the best. ✨_
